# About
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention says around 29.1 million people in the US have diabetes, and globally, the World Health Organization estimates 347 million people have the disease. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye problem linked to long-term diabetes. About 40-45% of Americans with diabetes have some level of DR. If DR is found early, the risk of vision loss can be reduced, but it's hard to detect early because it often has few symptoms until it's too late for effective treatment.

Right now, finding DR takes a lot of time and involves a person looking at photos of the retina. Human reviewers take a day or two to give results, leading to problems like missed follow-ups and delayed treatment.

Doctors can identify DR by looking for certain signs in the retina, but this method needs a lot of resources. Places with high diabetes rates often lack the expertise and tools for this kind of detection. As more people get diabetes, the resources needed to prevent blindness from DR will be even more stretched.

People have recognized the need for an easy and automated way to screen for DR for a long time. Previous efforts have made progress using technology like image recognition and machine learning. In this competition, the goal is to create a system that can automatically detect DR from color photos of the retina. The hope is to make a model that can be widely used to improve DR detection, and the winning models will be shared with the public to have the biggest impact.
